# Vue Todo MVC example

This example demonstrates how you can use Reactive CRDT to build a collaborative version of the [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com) app.

The code is based on the [official Vue 3 Todo MVC example](https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/todomvc.html). Minimum changes were needed to make the App work with Reactive CRDT.

# Running
